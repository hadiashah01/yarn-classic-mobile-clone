# Yarn Mobile Layout Clone

This project is a mobile-first clone of a modern web interface, designed to practice responsive layouts, Flexbox, and structured UI design. The focus was on building a clean, functional, and scalable layout suitable for small screens.

## Project Inspiration

The layout is inspired by the [Yarn Classic website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com)

It demonstrates multiple content sections including hero banners, feature highlights, call-to-action blocks, and footers, all stacked for mobile readability.

## Folder Structure

```bash
yarn-mobile-clone/

## Source Code

[CSS Styles](./style.css): Mobile-first styling with Flexbox for layout, consistent spacing using padding and margins, responsive images, and utility classes for alignment.
